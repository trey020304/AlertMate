    "date": "Dec 11, 2024 2:15 PM PHT",
    "description": "MANILA, Philippines – Fisherfolk group Pamalakaya and environmental group Kalikasan People’s Network filed before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, December 11, a petition for a writ of kalikasan and continuing mandamus against Manila Bay seabed quarry projects and reclamations."
        "The petitioners want the High Court to decide if the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) “violated their mandate for failure to assess the risks and impacts of seabed quarrying and reclamation in Manila Bay.”"
        "The DENR and the PRA are respondents in the petition."
        "They said that between 2019 and 2023, the DENR issued at least 10 seabed quarry permits, and the PRA approved 13 applications for reclamation in Manila Bay. Three of these seabed quarry projects, petitioners said, will supply materials for the reclamation projects in Manila Bay."
        "The groups are also asking the SC to determine if the respondents violated environmental laws and if injured fisherfolk are entitled to damages."
        "The writ of kalikasan is a legal remedy that protects Filipinos’ constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology."
        "The SC can direct the DENR and PRA to perform their mandates if the court decides to issue a continuing mandamus."

    "description": "In Eastern Samar, locals rely on traditional weather lore to predict storms, but experts urge a blend of these beliefs with scientific insights for better preparedness"
        "EASTERN SAMAR, Philippines – At 58, Gemma Amit has seen enough typhoons to know when the weather is about to change. She’s learned to read the signs – the red sky, the chirping of birds, the sudden calm – each a precursor to the chaos that’s soon to unfold."
        "She recalls the old belief passed down by her forefathers from Borongan, Eastern Samar: “Pag nagpupurula it langit, naghuhuni an katamsihan, ura-ura an paghimutang han mga bukad pati tanom; mayda karaotan hit panahon nga tikadara-on.”"
        "(When the sky turns red, the birds chirp, and the flowers and plants bloom beautifully, bad weather is about to come.)"
        "These signs have shaped the way people in the region prepare for the storms that batter the Philippines with relentless frequency."

        "The archipelagic nature of the country contributes to the difficulty entailed in transporting relief goods, Revilla said in his bill's explanatory note."
        "More often than not, the transport of these goods, despite humanitarian reasons, entails huge cost, he said."
